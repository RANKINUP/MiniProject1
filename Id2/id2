1. orientation matters, otherwise the led will blow out
2. otherwise the led will blow out as the current will be too high
3. Changes the brightness of the led
4. does not affect results
5.we did this
6. Low, High (affects voltage)

Part 2
1. Insert code here

Part 3
1. digital read: reads in the that the input is connect to ground completing the circuit
2. the if function reads the low voltage and turns the led on or off depending on the button pushed
